# Update for Angular 4 and angular-cli

Dear Reader,

This update is to help you use Angular 4 and the angular-cli package. There are few breaking changes between Angular 2 and Angular 4, which makes the migration relatively simple.

 Since I wrote the original text, the angular-cli package has become the most common way to create and develop Angular projects. Working with angular-cli is easier than setting up a project manually, especially when it comes to deployment.

In this update, you will find replacements  for the key chapters in Part 1 of Pro Angular and replacement source code for all of the chapters in the book. You will also find a summary of changes that will help you migrate to Angular 4 and angular-cli in your own projects.

I hope that this update will make the switch Angular 4 and angular-cli simple and painless. If you get stuck, you can email me at `adam@adam-freeman.com` and I will try to help you get back on track.
