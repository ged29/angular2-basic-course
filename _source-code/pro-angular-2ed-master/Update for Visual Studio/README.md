# Working with Visual Studio

When I wrote Pro Angular, I promised an update that would explain how to use Visual Studio for Angular development. When I started to write that update, it grew into something more substantial as I worked through the issues of getting Angular to play nicely with ASP.NET Core MVC.

The result was a 300-page book that digs into a lot of detail. That book is called *Essential Angular for ASP.NET Core MVC*, which you can find on [Apress.com](http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484229156) or [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Angular-ASP-NET-Core-MVC/dp/1484229150/ref=sr_1_2).

To honor my promise for the update, I asked Apress to excerpt Chapter 3 from the *Essential Angular* and post it here. This chapter demonstrates how to combine Angular and ASP.NET Core MVC in a single project without using project scaffolding and explains how all of the pieces fit together. 

I hope this will help committed Visual Studio users who want to use their favorite editor for Angular development. If you have questions or queries, then you can email me at adam@adam-freeman.com and I will do my best to assist you.
